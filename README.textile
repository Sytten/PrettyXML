h2. Current features

* *Collapsable elements*: Alt+click to expand/collapse all descendant elements
* *Outline* for better document overview
* *Search by name or XPath*. By default uses simple search mode which looks for a partial match in element‘s or attribute’s name; use special symbols like '/' or '[' to search by XPath
* *Quick XPath mode*: hold down Command (Mac) or Ctrl (PC) key while moving mouse cursor over element‘s or attribute’s name to enter Quick XPath mode. Use Shift key to cycle through available XPath variants and then drag’n’drop element under cursor into text editor.
_Google Chrome users: click on element will copy XPath to clipboard_

_Soon_

You can also download an "XSL stylesheet":https://github.com/sergeche/xmlview/downloads and use it for styling XML files with @<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="xv-browser.xsl"?>@
